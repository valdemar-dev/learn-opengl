# LearnOpenGL
I wanted to learn some graphics programming.
So, naturally, I chose OpenGL (as low level as I could get),
and C, (a programming language and paradigm I have no prior experience with).

Each commit in this repo will be once I have successfully completed a chapter of the LearnOpenGL book.
